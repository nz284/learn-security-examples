Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

vulnerability means when a session starts, a session ID created and stores in cookie of browser. The session may be spoofed if user has session ID.

If someone other takes session ID, session can be accessed with admin's authority right. And When cookie is stored, session ID will be sent with request header.  

In secure version, middleware set session ID in cookie of browser to httpOnly =true, this requires document.cookie. sameSite=true, makes session not sent to other sites. Then if there is a request sent, there is some authority.certainty that the request is from a valid client.
