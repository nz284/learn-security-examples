Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Attacker can temper with app's inputs, then things entered into the form by the user is actually read and used by the server.
Attacker can type code in the form or insert a hyperlink, the server will run it.

The secure version: we take inputs and sanitize, clear anything that could be script. Then the script won't enter server.
