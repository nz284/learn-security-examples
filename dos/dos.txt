- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

DoD attacks make resource unaccisible for users. It can overwhelming the resource with excessive requests, 
exploiting a vulnerability to crash a system, or interrupting the normal operation of a service. 
This kind of attack can be mitigated through network security measures, such as traffic filtering, 
rate limiting and redundant system design.
